# Running Tests

You must install the test-runner dependencies:
```
pip3 install -r tests/requirements.txt
```

Then make the `seedsigner` python module visible/importable to the tests by installing it:
```
pip3 install -e .
```

Run the whole test suite:
```
pytest
```

Run a specific test file:
```
pytest tests/test_this_file.py
```

Run a specific test:
```
pytest tests/test_this_file.py::test_this_specific_test
```
